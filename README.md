I still remember the insta story she uploaded after fresher's night in which Eshan was lifting her up and she wrote - "I like the way you grab me." I remember Amin showing me those prom night pics in which Eshan was kneeling down on his knees with a rose in his hand. And she was smiling, looking at him. I still remember Eshan holding her waist and resting his chin on her shoulder when she was just infront of me. She was also holding his hand which he had kept around her waist. I still remember numerous such incidents between her and Eshan. I saw them once coming out from Felicity ground at night when it was dark. My mind had that thought only but I pacified myself that nothing like that would have happened. Does she knows how harassed I felt looking her like that ? Does she knows how many times I have tried killing myself because of that ?

My nights still pass with your thoughts 

The craziness for you

Still exists today.

This heart❤️ doesn't beats for any1 else

The loyalty for you

Still exists today.

I wish you had loved me once 

And then left me 

Your right to break my heart💔 and go away

Still exists today.
